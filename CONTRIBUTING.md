## Simple set of practices that helps maintain a useful codebase


1. Ensure there are no git remains `.orig` `.base' etc.
2. Try to keep the git log a straight line as possible
      * where possible and sensible do a fast forward merge      
3. Always create feature branch or forks which can merged through a pull request
4. Start by having discussion - github issues would be a good place to bounce your ideas before you invest time in writing code
5. Always accompany code changes with documentation - so that code base always remains relevant to people trying to consume it.
