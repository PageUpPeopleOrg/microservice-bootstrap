## Simple set of information that we can value by following in our contributing practices


1. Ensure there are no git remains `.orig` `.base' etc.
2. Try to keep the branch tree straight as possible
      * where possible and sensible do a fast forward merge
      * Use a feature branch 
3. Always fork and create pull requests
4. Start by having discussion - github issues would be a good place to bounce your ideas before you invest time in writing code
5. Always accompany code changes with documentation - so that code base always remains relevant to people trying to consume it.
